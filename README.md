### :zap: A to-be Electronics & Communication Engineer
![A Cool GIF](https://github.com/Kabiirk/kabiirk/blob/main/gifs/elect_c.gif)
Studying E&CE, My strengths are Digital Electronics and Sensor Interfacing,currently focussing on learning C++ and Assembly(NASM) for embedded programming. My specialization lies in the domain of Internet of Things & my experience with working on cloud platforms like IBM Watson allow me to leverage that domain-knowledge with tools like Kafka, Docker and Kubernetes to create scalable & automated solutions.

### :abacus: I'm a Data Science Enthusiast
![Another Cool GIF](https://github.com/Kabiirk/kabiirk/blob/main/gifs/dse_c.gif)
My strengths as an analyst are my ability to work with large amounts of data, number crunching and attention to detail, which allows me to asses trends and patterns to come up with useful insights and present them succinctly with the helps of visualizations anfd effective communication. As an E&CE Engineer I am always looking for strategies to integrate disruptive automation technologies with data analytics to achieve higher degree of intelligence, integrity & interactivity during Data-acquisition, Processing-&-Analytics phases.
